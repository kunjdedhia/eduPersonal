# eduPersonal
Education made Personalised. 
## Inspiration
Everyone is different. We learn at different speeds, study at different levels, and retain different amounts of information. Some of us don't like to ask questions in class when we don't understand, and some others just fly through material. Ideally, we would all have personalized assessments and homework to help us.
## What it does
eduPersonal is an educational platform that gives students control over their education by catering closely to their individual needs. This is done through the analysis of a student's performance in different courses they've picked during in university and the teacher's input. After assessment, teachers are then able to analyze their class and understand where students struggle and are strong.
eduPersonal has its own database of questions for a variety of courses that are offered at the institution and the database continues to diversify. 
## How I built it
I began working on the project with scripting the user interface in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The backend uses PHP and MariaDb for storage of questions.
